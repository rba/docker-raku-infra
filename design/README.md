# design.raku.org

This directory contains a Docker setup to build and serve the static
[https://design.raku.org](https://design.raku.org) website.

The Dockerfile is basically inspired by the
[`util/update-design.perl6.org.sh`](https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/util/update-design.perl6.org.sh)
script from the [`mu` repository](https://github.com/perl6/mu).
